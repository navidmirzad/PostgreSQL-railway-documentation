ðŸ“– Documentation for Integrating with PostgreSQL Database
Introduction
For this project, my initial thought was to use MySQL since I had the most experience with it. However, after evaluating various databases, I decided to use PostgreSQL due to its fine-grained access control and robust security at both row and column levels (db-engines.com, 2025).

# Why PostgreSQL?
âœ… Supports strict security down to the row and column level
âœ… Allows granular access control using roles and privileges
âœ… Supports custom objects, inheritance, and polymorphism (object-relational DB)
âœ… Well-suited for structured data and complex queries

ðŸ”´ Downside: Unlike MongoDB, which supports a wide variety of programming languages, PostgreSQL primarily focuses on popular and widely-used languages.

# Getting Started with PostgreSQL
ðŸ“Œ Installation
# Windows
Download PostgreSQL from the official site: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Alternative (via Chocolatey)
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
- choco install PostgreSQL
Important: If you select A (for installing scripts), an auto-generated password will be set. Copy it for later use.

PostgreSQL by default runs on port: 5432

# macOS
Install PostgreSQL via Homebrew:
- brew install PostgreSQL

Start PostgreSQL service:
- brew services start progresql

Access PostgreSQL using:
- psql postgres

# Connecting to the Database
ðŸ“Œ Default Connection
Once PostgreSQL is installed, open PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (macOS) and connect to the default postgres database:
- psql -U postgres
(If prompted, enter the password set during installation.)

# Connecting to the Hosted Railway PostgreSQL Database
ðŸ’» Connection Command (Windows/macOS)
To connect to the Railway-hosted PostgreSQL database, use the following commands depending on the role:

I have three different users in my database:
- admin with the password "admin"
- read_only_dept, password "readonly"
- emp1, password emp1

# for Windows

Admin:
$env:PGPASSWORD = "admin"
psql -h shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net -U admin -p 10363 -d railway

$env:PGPASSWORD = "readonly"
psql -h shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net -U read_only_dept -p 10363 -d railway

$env:PGPASSWORD = "emp1"
psql -h shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net -U emp1 -p 10363 -d railway


# for macOS:

// these two lines have to be separate lines
PGPASSWORD="password-for-given-user" 
psql -h shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net -U <user_name> -p 10363 -d railway

Database Roles & Permissions
Database has the following roles (users):

PostgreSQL Basic Commands
ðŸ“Œ List all databases

- \l

ðŸ“Œ Connect to a specific database

- \c database_name

ðŸ“Œ List all tables in the current database

- \dt

ðŸ“Œ List all roles (users) in the database

- \du

ðŸ“Œ Show table schema

\d table_name

# Example on queries you can make after connecting to the DB
- SELECT * FROM department;
- INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES (4, 'Finance');
